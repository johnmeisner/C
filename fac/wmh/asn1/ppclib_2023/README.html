  <h2><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Thank you for downloading this release of the ASN1C software. ASN1C is an
    ASN.1 compiler (code generator) capable of parsing and generating C, C++,
    C#, Java, Python, or Go source code for the most advanced ASN.1 syntax.

    <p>This package contains the ASN1C compiler executables and run-time
    libraries. Documentation is available online at <a href=
    "https://obj-sys.com/support/asn1c-manuals.php">

  <h2><a name="WhatsNew" id="WhatsNew"></a>Release Notes</h2>

  <blockquote>
    This release of ASN1C adds the following new capabilities:

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Support added for BER/DER encode and decode in Go</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Support has been added for generating code in Go to support the
          Basic and Distinguised Encoding Rules (BER and DER). For BER, this
          includes support for 3GPP TS 32.297 headers for CDR processing.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>New command-line option -go-rt-inc added for Go</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The -go-rt-inc (Go run-time include) command-line option has been
          added to allow a user to force inclusion of a Go run-time module
          in the compiled module set. Normally Go compilation includes only
          the dependent modules for a given compilation. The main purpose of
          this is to allow a user to include a module that they may be
          interested in using in their main.go file (for example, TS 32.297,
          TBCD, BCD, or BER dump utility functions).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Updated C# project file generation</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>C# project file generation (the -vcproj qualifier) has been changed 
          to make the default version Visual Studio 2019.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Support for .Net v5 and .Net v6</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The ASN1C SDK and C# run-time kits now contain asn1rt DLLs that
          target .Net v5 and .Net v6.  The DLL that targets .Net v4 is still
          included.</p>
        <p>New asn1c command line qualifiers named -dotnetv5 and -dotnetv6
          have been added that will cause a .Net v5 or .Net v6 .csproj file
          to be generated if used with the -csharp and -vcproj qualifiers.
          If neither of these new qualifiers is specified, a generated .csproj
          file will target .Net v4.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>PLMNidentity support</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>ASN1C will now recognize a production named PLMNidentity (e.g., from
          the RANAP specifications) and will treat it as an OCTET STRING.  A
          command line option -noPLMN has been added to disable this special
          recognition and treat the production as it's defined in the ASN.1.
          An &lt;isPLMNidentity&gt; configuraton file item has also been added
          at production level to identify any production as a PLMNidentity.
          This new functionality is supported for all languages.</p>
        <p>In line with the PLMNidentity changes, the following functions and
          methods have been added:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>C/C++:  rtStringToPLMNidentity(), rtGetMCCFromPLMNidentity(),
                and rtGetMNCFromPLMNidentity().</li>
                
            <li>Java:  Asn1Util.stringToPLMNidentity() and
                Asn1Util.PLMNidentityToString().</li>

            <li>C#:  Asn1Util.StringToPLMNidentity() and
                Asn1Util.PLMNidentityToString().</li>

            <li>Python:  plmnidentity_str_to_bin() and
                plmnidentity_bin_to_str() in util.py.</li>

            <li>Go:  StrToPLMNidentity() and PLMNidentityToStr() in
                PLMNidentityUtils.go</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Java XML parser options in the GUI</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Java XML parser options (XMLPull and StAX) have been added to the
          GUI. (A1C-727)</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>asn1c command in generated code</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Generated code will now contain a comment with the asn1c command that
          was used to do the generation. (A1C-678)</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Defined values for tags</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Tags can now use defined values for the tag value.  The value must
          be INTEGER type and non-negative.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Addition of the -dynamic command-line option</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The -dynamic command-line option has been added which has the same
        effect as adding &lt;storage>dynamic&lt;/storage> at the global level in
        a configuration file. It will cause dynamic memory to be used for all
        binary and character string types whether the type has a size constraint
        or not. It will also cause dynamic arrays to be used for repeating
        types. In addition, this will also now cause a dynamic array to be used
        for the set of subidentifiers in an OBJECT IDENTIFIER or RELATIVE-OID
        structure.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Named bit support in print to stream and print to string</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Code generated for C or C++ with print to stream or print to string
        enabled will now print names of bits in BIT STRINGs where applicable.
        This feature was already present in code generated for regular
        printing.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Modified distribution file names for macOS</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Distribution files for macOS now have names that more accurately
          convey the target platform.  For macOS on x64 the distribution file
          will have macos_x64 in the name, and for macOS on M1 the distribution
          file will have macos_m1 in the name.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>Modified handling of non-fatal C/C++ decoding errors</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>In v7.6 C/C++ decoding the only non-fatal decoding errors that would
          be reported at the end of the decode step would be constraint
          violations.  In v7.7 any non-fatal decoding errors will be reported,
          not just constraint violations.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>TBCD utilities for Go</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Utilities to convert a TBCD array to a string and to convert a
          string to a TBCD array have been added in a new file named
          TBCDUtils.go.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>BCD utilities for Python</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Utilities to convert a BCD array to a string and to convert a
          string to a BCD array have been added to the util.py file.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><b>BCD utilities for Go</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Utilities to convert a BCD array to a string and to convert a
          string to a BCD array have been added in a new file named
          BCDUtils.go.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>New Java TS32297Encode sample</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A new java/sample_ber/TS32297Encode sample has been added that shows
        how to encode TS 32.297 headers using Java.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>New C# TS32297Encode sample</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A new csharp/sample_ber/TS32297Encode sample has been added that
          shows how to encode TS 32.297 headers using C#.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>New Commands added to the ASN1C GUI</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The 'File->Open Folder..' and 'Edit->Find in Files/Replace in Files'
          commands were added to the ASN1C GUI. The former allows opening a
          folder containing ASN.1 and configuration files all of which
          will be opened in the editor. The 'Find/Replace in Files' commands
          allows multiple files to be searched at a time.</p>

  <h2><a name="CodeGenChanges" id="CodeGenChanges"></a>Compatibility</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The C/C++ types generated for the built-in EXTERNAL and EmbeddedPDV
    types are different due to the -dynamic option described above. That
    is because these types are configured to use dynamic storage and this
    caused a different type to be used for the OBJECT IDENTIFIER's contained
    within (ASN1DynOBJID instead of ASN1OBJID).</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The C/C++ print to string capability has been enhanced so the string
    that gets created contains the names of bits for BIT STRINGs that have
    such identifiers.  Existing code that uses this functionality may need
    to be revised to allocate a larger buffer.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>In v7.6 C/C++ decoding the only non-fatal decoding errors that would be
    reported at the end of the decode step would be constraint violations.  In
    v7.7 any non-fatal decoding errors will be reported, not just constraint
    violations.  This change may cause some decode scenarios to terminate with
    an error that didn't before.</p>

  <h2><a name="UnixInstall" id="UnixInstall"></a>UNIX/Linux Installation</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The steps to install ASN1C on a UNIX or Linux system are as
    follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download the ASN1C package that is of interest to you. Packages are
      available online for Linux (x64, x86, and ARM), and macOS 
      operating systems. There are different C/C++ versions of these packages 
      containing run-time libraries built with GNU gcc/g++ or native 
      compilers. There is also a Java package available for each of these 
      operating systems.</li>

      <li>ASN1C for UNIX/Linux is packaged in a zipped .tar.gz file. To
      install, untar the file (tar xzf) in any directory.
      Note that in order to run the sample programs, write access to the
      sample directories is required, so make sure that you have write access
      to the base directory where the compiler is installed.</li>

      <li>After installation is complete, the license for the product must be
      installed. This can come in two forms - as a license file or a license
      key value.  Instructions for installing the license key or file are 
      available the the following URL:

        <p><a href="https://obj-sys.com/support/acguiLicInstall.php">
            https://obj-sys.com/support/acguiLicInstall.php</a></p>

        <p>The compiler should now be operational. The following command can
        be executed:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <tt>&lt;rootdir&gt;/bin/asn1c</tt>
        </blockquote>

        <p>to verify operation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>To use the Python code generation capability, the Python run-time
        package must first be installed.  This can be done by executing the
        following command:<br>
        
        <blockquote>
          <tt>pip install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime --no-deps osyspyrt</tt>
        </blockquote>

      </li>
    </ol>

      <dd>
        <p>The command-line compiler executable file. This is invoked on
        ASN.1 or XSD source files to generate C, C++, C#, Java, or Python
        encode/decode classes and functions. It is recommended you modify
        your PATH environment variable to include
        <tt>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin</tt> to allow the compiler executable to
        be run from anywhere.</p>

        <p>The compiler graphic user interface (GUI) editor executable file.
        This GUI guides a user through the process of specifying ASN.1 or XSD
        source files and options. (Note: this binary is currently only
        available on Linux x64 systems).  The acgui.sh  shell script will set
        environment variables required by the GUI so that all required shared
        object files can be located.</p>

        <p>The ASN1C run-time static libraries and shared object files. These
        contain the low-level run-time functions for the various encoding
        rules supported by ASN1C. Note that the evaluation and development
        libraries are not fully optimized (they contain diagnostic tracing
        and are not compiled with compiler optimization turned on). The
        deployment libraries are fully optimized.  Also note that 'lib' 
        is a soft link to a directory containing libraries built with a 
        specific compiler version (for example, libgcc4).  To switch
        libraries, all that needs to be done in to change this soft link
        and the equivalent soft link to the platform.mk file to point at 
        a different version.  See the README file within the c or cpp
        directory for futher details.</p>

        <p>The optimized and/or compact version of the ASN1C run-time 
          libraries. These libraries have all diagnostic messages, error 
          stack trace and text, and non-essential status checks removed. 
          The optimized libraries are built with C compiler speed 
          optimizations options set; the compact libraries use space 
          optimization options.  (Note: these libraries are only
          available in the licensed deployment version of the product. If you
          wish to do performance testing, please <a href=
          "http://www.obj-sys.com/contact-us.php">contact us</a> and we will
          make them available to you). As was the case for the non-optimized 
          libraries, the directories are soft links to directories containing

        <p>The sample directories contain sample programs demonstrating the
        use of the compiler. There are a set of sample programs that
        correspond to each encoding rule set supported by ASN1C. Most sample
        programs are broken down into a writer and a reader. The writer
        encodes a sample data record and writes it to a disk file. The reader
        reads the encoded message from the file, decodes it, and then prints
        the results of the decode operation.</p>

    The compiler must be run from a command shell prompt. The compiler can 
    be run using either the GUI or from the command line. To run the GUI
    on an non-Mac system, execute the acgui.sh shell script from within the
    bin directory of the installation.  To run the GUI on a Mac system,
    in Finder double click the acgui app shown in the bin directory of the
    installation.  To run a simple test from the command line, do the 
    following:

    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Change directory (cd) to one of the employee sample directories
      (for example, <tt>c/sample_ber/employee</tt>).</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Execute the <tt>make</tt> utility program:

        <p><tt>make</tt></p>

        <p>This should cause the compiler to be invoked to compile the
        <tt>employee.asn</tt> sample file. It will then invoke the C or C++
        compiler to compile the generated C file and the test drivers. The
        result should be a <tt>writer</tt> and <tt>reader</tt> program file
        which, when invoked, will encode and decode a sample employee
        record.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke writer from the command line:

        <p><tt>writer</tt></p>

        <p>This will generate an encoded record and write it to a disk file.
        By default, the file generated is <i>message.dat</i> (in the case of
        XER, it is <i>message.xml</i>). The test program has a number of
        command line switches that control the encoding. To view the
        switches, enter <i>writer ?</i> and a usage display will be
        shown.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Invoke reader from the command line:

        <p><tt>reader</tt></p>

        <p>This will read the disk file that was just created by the writer
        program and decode its contents. The resulting decoded data will be
        written to standard output. The test program has a number of command
        line switches that control the encoding. To view the switches, enter
        <i>reader ?</i> and a usage display will be shown.</p>

        reader and writer programs (Note: JDK 6 was used to build all the
        run-time library classes). It will also automatically execute the
        writer and reader programs. These programs will produce a writer.log
        and reader.log file respectively.</p>

      <li>View the writer and reader log files. The writer.log file will

    <p>Before Python can be used, the Python run-time must be installed using
      the following command:<br>
      <tt>pip install --find-links https://www.obj-sys.com/PythonRuntime --no-deps osyspyrt</tt>
    <p>
    The compiler can then be run using either the GUI wizard or from the command
    line. To run the GUI wizard, launch the application and follow the steps.
    To run a simple test from the command line, do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Open a terminal bash shell window and cd to one of the sample 
        directories under the python subdirectory. For example,
        python/sample_ber/employee.</li>

      <li>Execute the <i>make</i> command to run the complete sample
        program. The makefile will invoke the ASN1C compiler to generate
        Python code for the ASN.1 definition and then compile and run the
        writer.py and reader.py scripts.</li>

      <li>Execute <i>python writer.py</i> to encode a binary message and
        write it to a file.</li>

      <li>Execute <i>python reader.py</i> to read the file containing encoded
        binary message and decode it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that the evaluation version of the Python code generation
      capability contains limits on the size of the ASN.1 files that can be
      compiled. It is inteneded to just demonstrate the basic functionality
      of this capability. To remove these limits, either a commercial-use
      license must be purchased, or a special evaluation license agreement
      signed.</p>

        golang/sample_per/employee.</li>

      <li>Execute the <i>make</i> command to run the complete sample

        The Go executable file is named 'go_test'.</li>
