======== access_cfg ========

== PURPOSE ==
The access_cfg utility provides access to the locked /rwflash/configs/ parameters on RSUs using CfgMgr APIs.
The utility is intended for internal use only and is not built into the firmware image or released to customers.
The automated test suite uses the utility as a server.
With access_cfg, a user can set and get any parameter in .conf files found in the previously mentioned directory,
 along with other functions.
 
== CREATION == 
To create a new version of access_cfg, run 'make' in hdsvnrepo/trunk/RSU/iMX6/Source/C/srv/hdmgr and it will be
 generated in the /.bin directory. 

== USAGE ==
access_cfg can be used as a server or as a command-line utility. 
To use as a command-line utility, store access_cfg in (example) /mnt/cflash/ and run with -h (help) flag for usage details:
 /mnt/cflash/access_cfg -h
To use as a server, load access_cfg onto an RSU and start it without any arguments:
 /mnt/cflash/access_cfg
The server will listen for a comma-separated line of input from a client (see testSuite/framework/Client.py for details).
