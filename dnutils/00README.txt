Yes, this directory of shell scripts and (oh my god...) BINARIES is in Source/C/ ....   The fullgit recipe only
copies from Source/C and below .. and the Makefile that builds the install is in
Source/C ...

The binaries are prebuilt and I don't have source; so hopefully they
work.  These scripts/bins, unlike the ../scripts directory are installed
into the path on the target.
