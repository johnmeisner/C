PCAPTool (resend) Instructions
( for the Ethernet replay tool see readme-eth )
===================================

The resend utility (what it is called upon compilation) will
take a pcap file with WSMs and broadcast the WSMs on a WSU.
The resend utility can be compiled for both the WSU5001 and
the WSU1.0/1.5.  You must be in the appropriate development
environment in order to compile the tool.

The initial implementation only supports BSMs.  Future updates
may add support for other types of WSMs (or possibly a mix).


BUILD
***************
Run 'make' in your development environment.


DEPLOY
***************
Copy the file to your desired WSU.  Also copy the
resend.conf file if you don't plan on providing all of the
configuration parameters via the command line.


CONFIGURATION
***************
The resend utility supports broadcasting with security
enabled or disabled.  The setting will override whatever
WSMs are in the pcap file (ex: enable security and 
unsigned WSMs in the pcap will be broadcast signed).  If
enabling security, you must provide the location of the
security directory with the certificates as part of the
configuration.  The resend utility will automatically start
the security module so do not start that manually.
Additional configuration options are available (such as an
override PSID).  See the resend.conf file for all of the
settings or type resend -h on the WSU.


RUNNING
***************
The resend utility will accept command line options with the
configuration parameters.  If you use the resend.conf file,
all you need to do is start the resend program on the WSU
without any parameters.  You may choose to enable the iterate
mode which will continue broadcasting until you press Ctrl+C
to quit.  If you do not enable iteration, the program will
automatically exit once the end of the pcap file is reached.
If you enable debug, a resend.log and optional resend.csv file
will be created in the same directory as the resend utility.
Only one pcap file is supported.  If you need to use multiple
pcap files, merge the contents into a single file.
