SDK Packaging Steps
==============================
The files generated for the SDK are connected to each release.  But,
the rsuSdkShm.h file has array length values that are not correct because
the utility generating the file is compatible with the VM and not the
QNX OS on the target.  You must run the release on the target to obtain
the actual lengths of the arrays.  If you do not, the SDK will be
incompatible when used by external users.  Follow the steps below to
finish the SDK.

1. Install your firmware on a WSU/RSU system.
2. Connect to the serial console, or set up the system to have i2v start manually.
3. If connected to the serial console, boot the WSU.  If starting i2v manually, start i2v after rebooting.
4. When i2v starts up, look for a message "S: xxxx yyyy" where xxxx and yyyy are actual numbers. The message displays near the end.
5. The first number is for the rsvd1DONOTACCESS member in the rsuSdkShm.h.  The second number is the rsvd2DONOTACCESS member.
6. Edit the rsuSdkShm.h file to add the correct values and remove the comment in the file about replacing the array values.
7. Create a zip or tar file that contains the rsuSdkShm.h, sdk_types.h, and examples directory.  Keep them in the same directory structure.
8. The zip is the SDK.



For future modifications (new shared memory to expose), be sure to update i2v.c and i2vsdkgenerator.c appropriately.
