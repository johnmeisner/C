The source code in this directory was originally in Source/C/dnutils.
That was not the correct location since everything in that folder gets pushed
into the final image.  Upon closer inspection, the associated Makefile for
the source code was never quite integrated into the build so this source
code is not compiled as part of the build.  If changes are required to the
binary utilities in the Source/C/dnutils directory, these are the files to
modify and build.  It may be more appropriate in the future to build them
as part of the build rather than use stored binaries.
